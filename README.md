## Overview

In Oahu Hawaii, we have proposed to open a "Surf n' Shake" store that will sell surfing equipment and ice cream. In order to receive financial support from investors, we have to confirm that the weather in Oahu is usually warm and sunny. In other words, the temperature needs to be on average near 70 degrees or higher, and there cannot be frequent rain falls. 

## Results

As expected, the temperature in December is cooler on average than in June. Nevertheless, the temperature is almost always above 60 degrees, meaning it is still warm enough to graph ice cream after breaking a sweat from beachball. In addition, June is definitely warm, but not too warm as the temperature rarely exceeds 85 degrees. Since this data is based on over a 1,000 observations made over several year, we can trust that this data is reliable and will remain this way for years to come. 

## Conclusion

From the data collected, the "Surf n' Shake" is almost a guaranteed success. The temperatures are warm even in the winter season, and the rain will rarely dampen the store's success.
